- Declare an API in an interface that calls protected function that implements the API, this implementation should be defined by another
party: client, another component... (episode 19, also used to implement Hazel::CreateApplication).
The purpose of this design is to expose static function as API where their impementation are done in other places. 

- Singleton design by declaring the instance as private in the interface, and define (create) it using a derivative class that implements
the interface. This will give the user an abstraction on the lower level and will concentrate on only the usage of the interface.
